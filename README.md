# Raspberry-Pi-centralised-control

Idea:
A word processing class in a high school has many Raspberry Pi computers that the learners uses. The learners are computer illiterate and some that have knowledge are performing unwanted tasks. Thus, a centralized control is needed to monitor and restart faulty devices from in front of the classroom, and therefore reducing wasted time on troubleshooting.
